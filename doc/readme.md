# User Guide

AntlrVSIX is an extension for Visual Studio 2019 and 2017.
With [Antlr4BuildTasks](https://github.com/kaby76/Antlr4BuildTasks),
this extension provides support for
writing C# applications using the [Antlr](http://antlr.org) parser generator. The extension
uses the latest Antlr tool download, providing build rules to compile and run in the
IDE.

In addition, AntlrVSIX is being extended to support a number of
programming languages (Java, Python, Rust). The tool works
by abstracting features common to all programming 
languages. In theory, because the machinery in AntlrVSIX has been done for one language,
editor functions can be reused for faster
development of programming language support in the IDE.
