# User Guide

AntlrVSIX is an extension for Visual Studio 2019 and 2017.
With [Antlr4BuildTasks](https://github.com/kaby76/Antlr4BuildTasks),
this extension provides support for
writing C# applications using the [Antlr](http://antlr.org) parser generator. The extension
uses the latest Antlr tool download, providing build rules to compile and run in the
IDE.

In addition, AntlrVSIX is being extended for a number of
programming languages (Java, Python, Rust). The tool works
by abstracting features common to all programming 
languages. In theory, editor operations for one 
language can be quickly applied to another for faster
development of programming language support in the IDE.
